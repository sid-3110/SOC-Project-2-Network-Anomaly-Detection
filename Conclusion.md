## Conclusion

This project helped me understand how SOC analysts detect suspicious
network activity by analyzing DNS and outbound traffic patterns.

I learned that identifying abnormal behavior does not require deep
packet inspection. Instead, recognizing repetition, timing,
and context is essential for effective SOC investigation.

This project reflects real SOC Level 1 responsibilities and
decision-making processes.
