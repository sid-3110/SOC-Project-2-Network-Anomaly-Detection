# SOC Project 2: Suspicious Network Activity Detection

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand how a SOC Level 1 analyst
identifies suspicious network activity using DNS and IP behavior.

This project focuses on recognizing abnormal outbound connections,
DNS abuse, and beaconing patterns without deep packet inspection.

---

## Why This Project Matters
Many malware infections communicate with external servers using DNS
or HTTP. SOC analysts often detect these threats by identifying
abnormal traffic patterns rather than analyzing individual packets.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic understanding (SOC level)
- DNS behavior analysis
- Beaconing detection concepts
- Pattern-based investigation
- SOC escalation decision making

---

## Tools & Concepts Used
- DNS logs (conceptual)
- IP reputation awareness
- SOC investigation mindset
- Network behavior analysis

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how a SOC analyst detects suspicious
network behavior by analyzing patterns and context rather than
relying on deep technical packet analysis.
